          I am a Web Developer skilled in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NodeJS,
          Bootstrap, ExpressJS, EJS, and MongoDB. My love for video games, and
          the idea of being able to build applications lured me into
          programming. I have worked on amazing projects like Geo-Search (a
          Geo-weather App), Getting Killed and Injured - GKAI (a logical game)
          amongst others. I'm a former Andela Intern and working with developers
          ecosystem. I attribute my growth as a developer to consistent learning
          and development and also takes pride and pleasure in teaching and
          imparting people with my wealth of knowledge. When I'm not coding or
          studying, I spend my leisure time playing games, watching movies, and
          series.
